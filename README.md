This is a project that was worked on from a Udemy Course **React, NodeJS, Express & MongoDB - The MERN Fullstack Guide** by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller and Manuel Lorenz.

## Project Setup
To run this project after cloning it, run 
``` npm install ```
to download all the node modules needed.

## API Keys and Variables
Changing variables happens in the ```nodemon.json``` file for local development.A Google API Key is not provided since we generated random latitude & longitudes (however the code does include the api call to the Google API but it is commented).
